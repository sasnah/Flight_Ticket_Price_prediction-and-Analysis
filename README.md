#  Flight Ticket Price Analysis

This project is focused on analyzing flight ticket prices using Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Power BI for data visualization. The goal is to identify patterns and key factors that influence ticket pricing.

## Project Files

- `Flight_Ticket_EDA.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA.
- `Flight_Ticket(Power_Bi).pbix` â€“ Power BI report that visualizes the insights from the analysis.

##  Objective

To explore and analyze the flight ticket dataset to answer the following questions:
- How do different airlines affect ticket prices?
- What is the impact of journey duration and number of stops?
- How does timing (day/month) influence flight pricing?
- What trends can be visualized to help consumers and businesses?

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Power BI Desktop**

## Key Insights

- Ticket prices vary significantly across different airlines.
- Non-stop flights are generally more expensive than connecting flights.
- Evening and night flights tend to be cheaper than morning flights.
- Ticket prices increase as the travel date approaches.

##  Power BI Dashboard Highlights

The interactive Power BI dashboard includes:
- Average price per airline
- Price distribution across journey dates
- Flight counts from source to destination
- Duration and stop comparison
